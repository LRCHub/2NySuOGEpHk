[00:05.08] I'm not your friend or anything, damn
[00:09.33] You think that you're the man
[00:11.86] I think, therefore, I am
[00:15.10] I'm not your friend or anything, damn
[00:19.67] You think that you're the man
[00:22.18] I think, therefore I am
[00:33.68] 
[00:26.21] Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
[00:29.87] Get my pretty name outta your mouth
[00:32.20] We are not the same with or without
[00:36.25] Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
[00:39.74] Top of the world, but your world isn't real
[00:43.45] Your world's an ideal
[00:53.95] 
[00:46.07] So, go have fun
[00:47.77] I really couldn't care less
[00:48.94] And you can give 'em my best, but just know
[01:10.44] 
[00:51.07] I'm not your friend or anything, damn
[00:55.47] You think that you're the man
[00:57.98] I think, therefore I am
[01:01.13] I'm not your friend or anything, damn
[01:05.53] You think that you're the man
[01:08.08] I think, therefore I am
[01:19.58] 
[01:12.76] I don't want press to put your name next to mine
[01:15.82] We're on different lines, so I
[01:17.87] Wanna be nice enough
[01:19.43] They don't call my bluff 'cause I hate to find
[01:22.96] Articles, articles, articles
[01:25.00] Rather you remain unremarkable
[01:27.27] (Got a lotta) interviews, interviews, interviews
[01:30.33] When they say your name, I just act confused
[01:52.33] 
[01:32.16] Did you have fun?
[01:33.56] I really couldn't care less
[01:34.91] And you can give 'em my best, but just know
[01:56.41] 
[01:36.99] I'm not your friend or anything, damn
[01:41.33] You think that you're the man
[01:43.82] I think, therefore, I am
[01:47.07] I'm not your friend or anything, damn
[01:51.62] You think that you're the man
[01:53.93] I think, therefore, I am
[02:05.93] 
[01:57.94] I'm sorry
[02:01.43] I don't think I caught your name
[02:17.43] 
[02:08.09] I'm sorry
[02:11.69] I don't think I caught your name
[02:27.69] 
[02:27.99] I'm not your friend or anything, damn
[02:32.36] You think that you're the man
[02:34.96] I think, therefore, I am
[02:38.13] I'm not your friend or anything, damn
[02:42.64] You think that you're the man
[02:45.14] I think, therefore I am
