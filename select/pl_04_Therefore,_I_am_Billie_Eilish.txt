Me, I'm getting better everyday
That's what I said
Don't believe what you've heard
It's not like I want to be king
But I can't help myself
It's just that I am
Sorry, but i found someone new
To spend time
Instead on you, i spend it with
me
You see, I've been around the
world
I've seen so many things
Why am I talking to you?
Why do you hide, behind,
somebody else
There's one too many, in this
room, and I think it's you
As you can see, I'm a happy guy
Don't need nothin' to get me
down
'Cause I'll always have you
We are, are on a sinking ship
But I'd like to stay on board
And shoot the cannons at you
Why do you hide, behind,
somebody else
There's one too many, in this
room, and I think it's you
